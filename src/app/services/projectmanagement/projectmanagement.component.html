                    <p>
                        All the professional bodies offer guidelines on the level and type of information that should be
                        defined in the early stages of the project in the form of a Project Management Plan.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The purpose of such a document is to provide a comprehensive baseline of what has to be achieved
                        by
                        the project, how it is to be achieved, who will be involved, how it will be reported and
                        measured
                        and how information will be communicated. It should be used as a reference for any decision that
                        is
                        made on the project and for clarification of unclear areas.Such a document should be used as a
                        reference throughout the project to ensure that the management of the project is carried out
                        consistently and in line with policy and procedures. Although the PMP is developed as part of
                        the
                        project initiation and definition, it should be a living document that evolves as the project
                        progresses and is updated with the latest relevant information as required.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The PMP should be available to all project members as it can provide essential project
                        information
                        and can be used to introduce project members to the project. The project management plan is
                        probably
                        the main communication document for the project.
